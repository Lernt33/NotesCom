    <h1>Notescom - Mini Project</h1>
    <p>"Notescom" is a mini-project that showcases my skills in various technologies such as <strong>Git</strong>, <strong>SQL</strong>, <strong>Python Flask</strong> framework, <strong>SCSS</strong>, and custom password encryption methods.</p>
    <p>In "Notescom," users can create, view, edit, and delete notes securely. The project utilizes Git for version control, allowing for easy collaboration and tracking of changes. SQL is employed to manage the database, storing user information and notes securely.</p>
    <p><strong>Python Flask</strong> framework is the backbone of "Notescom," facilitating session management, blueprint creation for modular design, HTTP method handling (GET and POST), cookie management, caching for improved performance, and more. Sessions ensure secure user authentication and authorization, while blueprints allow for the organization of routes and views into separate modules for better maintainability.</p>
    <p>HTTP methods like GET and POST are treated appropriately to ensure proper handling of user requests. SCSS is used for styling the frontend, providing a clean and visually appealing user interface.</p>
    <p>One of the highlights of "Notescom" is the custom password encryption method implemented for enhanced security. User passwords are encrypted using a robust encryption algorithm, ensuring that sensitive information remains protected even in the event of a breach.</p>
    <p>Overall, "Notescom" demonstrates my proficiency in a range of technologies and showcases my ability to develop secure and functional web applications.</p>
